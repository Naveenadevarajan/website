      <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus.
           From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted,
            a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically 
            steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and 
            has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.It is one of the most popular drinks in the world and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press,
           caffelatte, or already-brewed canned coffee).It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar 
           substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.
           It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert, like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffeehouse or coffee shop 
          (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).

        <p>Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial as a stimulant in healthy adults, with continuing 
            research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk of some diseases, although some of the long-term studies are of questionable credibility.
            The earliest credible evidence of the drinking of coffee in the form of the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen from the middle of the 15th 
            century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to current methods.[2] The Yemenis procured the coffee 
            beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the
             Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe.</p>
